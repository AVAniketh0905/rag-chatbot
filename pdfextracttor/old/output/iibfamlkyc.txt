Money obtained from certain crimes, such as extortion, insider trading, drug trafficking,and illegal gambling is"dirty" and
needstobe"cleaned"toappeartohavebeenderivedfrom legal activities, so that banks and otherfinancial institutionswill
dealwithitwithoutsuspicion.Moneycanbelaunderedbymanymethodswhichvaryincomplexityandsophistication.
Money laundering involves three steps: The first involves introducing cash into the financial system by some means
("placement"); the second involves carrying out complex financial transactions to camouflage the illegal source of the cash
("layering"); and finally, acquiring wealth generated from the transactions of the illicit funds ("integration"). Some of these
steps may be omitted, depending upon the circumstances. For example, non-cash proceeds that are already in the financial
systemwouldnotneedtobeplaced.[8]
AccordingtotheUnitedStatesTreasuryDepartment:
Money laundering is the process of making illegally-gained proceeds (i.e., "dirty money") appear legal (i.e., "clean").
Typically, it involves three steps: placement, layering, and integration. First, the illegitimate funds are furtively introduced
into the legitimate financial system. Then, the money is moved around to create confusion, sometimes by wiring or
transferring through numerous accounts. Finally, it is integrated into the financial system through additional transactions
untilthe"dirtymoney"appears"clean".
2.Moneylaundering involves taking criminal proceeds and disguising their illegal source in anticipationof ultimately using
thecriminalproceedstoperformlegalandillegalactivities.

This environment has resulted in a situation where officials in these jurisdictions are either unwilling due to regulations, or
refusetocooperateinrequestsforassistanceduringinternationalmoneylaunderinginvestigations.
To combat this and other international impediments to effective money laundering investigations, many like-minded
countries have met to develop, coordinate, and share model legislation, multilateral agreements, trends & intelligence, and
other information. For example, such international watchdogs as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) evolved out of
thesediscussions.

The final stage of the money laundering process is termed the integration stage. It is at the integration stage where the
moneyisreturned tothecriminal fromwhatseemtobelegitimatesources. Havingbeenplacedinitiallyascashandlayered
through a number of financial transactions, the criminal proceedsare now fully integrated into the financial system and can
beusedforanypurpose.
There are many different ways in which the laundered money can beintegrated backwith the criminal; however, the major
objective at this stage is to reunite the money with the criminal in a manner that does not draw attention and appears to
result from a legitimate source. For example, the purchases of property, art work, jewellery, or high-end automobiles are

Placement—Laundererswant togettheirproceedsintolegitimaterepositoriessuchasbanks,securitiesorrealestate,with

deposits. However,cyberbanks could be organized to take custodial-like forms — holding, reconciling and transferring
rights to assets held in different forms around the world. Money launderers can create their own systems shadowing
traditional commercial banks in order to acceptdeposits, perhaps as warehouses for cash or otherbulk commodities. Thus,

 Bulk cash smuggling: This involves physically smuggling cash to another jurisdiction and depositing it in a
financial institution, such as an offshore bank, with greater bank secrecy or less rigorous money laundering
enforcement
 Cash-intensivebusinesses:Inthismethod,abusinesstypicallyexpectedtoreceivealargeproportionofitsrevenue
as cash uses its accounts to deposit criminally derived cash. Such enterprises often operate openly and in doing so
generatecashrevenuefromincidental legitimatebusinessinadditiontotheillicit cash–insuchcasesthebusinesswill
usually claim all cash received as legitimate earnings. Service businesses are best suited to this method, as such
enterprises have little or no variable costs and/or a large ratio between revenue and variable costs, which makes it
difficult to detect discrepancies between revenues and costs. Examples are parking structures, strip clubs, tanning
salons,carwashes,arcades,bars,restaurants,andcasinos.
 Trade-based laundering: This involves under- or over-valuing invoices to disguise the movement of money. For
example,the artmarkethas beenaccusedofbeinganidealvehicle formoneylaunderingdue toseveralunique aspects
of art such as the subjective value of artworks as well as the secrecy of auction houses about the identity of the buyer
andseller.
 Shell companies and trusts: Trusts and shell companies disguise the true owners of money. Trusts and corporate
vehicles, depending on the jurisdiction, need not disclose their true owner. Sometimes referred to by the slang
termrathole,thoughthattermusuallyreferstoapersonactingasthefictitiousownerratherthanthebusinessentity.
 Round-tripping: Here, money is deposited in a controlled foreign corporation offshore, preferably in a tax
haven where minimal records are kept, and then shipped back as a foreign direct investment, exempt from taxation. A

 Bank capture: In this case, money launderers or criminals buy a controlling interest in a bank, preferably in a

 Other gambling: Money isspent ongambling, preferably onhigh oddsgames. One way to minimize risk with this
method is to bet on every possible outcome of some event that has many possible outcomes, so no outcome(s) have
short odds, and the bettorwill lose only the vigorish and will have one or more winning bets that can be shown as the
sourceofmoney.Thelosingbetswillremainhidden.
 Real estate: Someone purchases real estate with illegal proceeds and then sells the property. To outsiders, the
proceeds from the sale look like legitimate income. Alternatively, the price of the property is manipulated: the seller
agrees to a contract that underrepresents the value of the property, and receives criminal proceeds to make up the
difference.
 Blacksalaries: Acompany may have unregisteredemployeeswithout written contractsand paythem cashsalaries.

In2005,FATFaddedanewtermtothevastmoneylaunderinglexicon–“cuckoosmurfing.
The term, mentioned in the organization’s 2005 Typologies Report,refers to a form of money laundering linked to
alternativeremittance systems, in which criminal funds are transferred through the accounts of unwitting persons who are
expectinggenuinefundsorpaymentsfromoverseas.ThetermcuckoosmurfingfirstoriginatedininvestigationsintheUnited
Kingdom, where it is asignificant money laundering technique.The cuckoo is a European bird that is a parasite because it
laysits eggs in the nests of other birds, which hatch them and rearthe offspring. The main difference between traditional
structurerand cuckoo smurfing is that in the latter the third parties who holdthe bank accounts being used are not aware of
the fact that illicitmoney is being deposited into their accounts.Cuckoo smurfing requires the work of an insider within a
financialinstitutionandisgenerallyafourstepprocess:
The first step occurs when a customer provides fundsto an alternative remitter for transfer to a beneficiary,generally in
anothercountry.
The next step involves the insider, who will provide the transaction details (beneficiary name, bank, accountnumber and
amount) ofthe transfertoanassociatein the foreign countrywhere thebeneficiaryofthetransfer islocated.Theassociate in

The associate in the foreign country will then depositcash into the bank account of the intended beneficiary.The

The Wolfsberg Group is an association of 13 global banks that aims to develop financial services industry standards and
related products for Know Your Customer, Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorist Financing policiesThe Group
first came together in 2000 at the Wolfsberg castle in Switzerland, accompanied by representatives of Transparency
International, to draft anti-money laundering guidelines for private banking that, when implemented, would mark an
unprecedented private-sector assault on the laundering of corruption proceeds. Their principles hold no force of law and
carry no penalties for those who do not abide by them. The Wolfsberg Anti-Money Laundering Principles for Private
Banking was published in October 2000 and was revised in May 2002. These principles recommend controls for private
bankingthatrangefromthebasic,suchascustomeridentification,toenhancedduediligence,suchasheightenedscrutinyof
individuals who “have or have had positions of public trust.” The banks that released the principles with Transparency
Internationalsaidthattheprincipleswould“makeitharderforcorruptpeopletodeposittheirill-gotten gainsintheworld’s
bankingsystem.”Theprinciplessaybankswill“endeavortoacceptonlythoseclientswhosesourceofwealthandfundscan
be reasonably established to be legitimate.” They highlight the need to identify the beneficial owner of funds “for all
accounts” when that person is someone other than the client, and urge private bankers to performdue diligence on “money
managers and similar intermediaries” to determine that the middlemen have a “satisfactory” due diligence process for their
clients or a regulatory obligation to conduct such due diligence. The principles recommend that “at least one person other
thantheprivatebanker”shouldapproveallnewclientsandaccounts.
Theprincipleslistseveralsituationsthatrequirefurtherduediligence,includingactivitiesthatinvolve:
Public officials, including individuals holding, or having held, positions of public trust, as well as their families and close
associates. High-risk countries, including countries “identified by credible sources as having inadequate anti-
moneylaundering standards or representing high-risk for crime and corruption.” High-risk activities, involving clients and
beneficial owners whose source of wealth “emanates from activities known to be susceptible to money laundering.” The
Wolfsbergprinciplessaythatbanksshouldhavewrittenpoliciesonthe“identificationofandfollow-uponunusualor
suspicious activities,” and should include a definition of what is suspicious, as well as examples of such activity. They
recommenda“sufficient”monitoringsystemthatusestheprivatebanker’s knowledgeofthetypesofactivitythatwouldbe
suspicious for particular clients. They also outline mechanisms that can be used to identify suspicious activity, including
meetings, discussions and in-countryvisits with clients and stepsthat should betaken when suspicious activity isdetected.
The principles also address: Reporting to manageMent of money laundering issues. AML training. Retention of relevant
documents.Deviationsfrompolicy.Creationofananti-moneylaunderingdepartmentand anAMLpolicy.
In May 2002, the Wolfsberg Principles for Private Banking were revised. A section was added prohibiting the use of
internal non-client accounts (sometimes referred to as “concentration” accounts) to keep clients from being linked to the
movement of funds on their behalf (i.e., banks should forbid the use of such internal accounts in a manner that would
prevent officialsfromappropriatelymonitoring movementsofclient funds).The WolfsbergGroupalso issuedguidelinesin
early 2002 on “The Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism,” outlining the roles of financial institutions in the fight
againstmoneylaunderingandterrorismfinancing.TheWolfsbergrecommendationsinclude:
Providingofficiallistsofsuspectedterroristsonagloballycoordinatedbasisbyrelevantauthorities.
Includingadequateinformationintheliststohelpinstitutionssearchcustomerdatabasesefficiently.
Providing prompt feedback to institutions following circulation of the official lists. Providing information on the manner,
means and methods used by terrorists. Developing government guidelines for business sectors and activities identified as
high-risk for terrorism financing. Developing uniform global formats for funds transfers that assist in the detection of
  17
 
18
terrorism financing. The group also recommends that financial institutions be protected by a safe harbor immunity to
encourage them to share information and to report to authorities. The Wolfsberg Group also committed itself to
recommending enhanced due diligence for “business relationships with remittance businesses, exchange houses, casas de
cambio, bureaux de change and money transfer agents…” and committed its members to taking enhanced due diligence
steps for high-risk customers or those in high-risk sectors, and activities “such as underground banking businesses or
alternative remittance systems.” In 2002, Wolfsberg issued guidelines on “Anti-Money Laundering Principles for
Correspondent Banking” that outlined steps financial institutions should take to combat money laundering and terrorism

17. Whentheclientaccountsareopenedbyprofessionalintermediaries:Whenthebankhasknowledgeorreasonto
believe that the client account opened by a professional intermediary is on behalf of a single client, that client
must be identified. Banks may hold 'pooled' accounts managed by professional intermediaries on behalf of
  26
 
27
entities like mutual funds, pension funds or other types of funds. Banks, however, should not openaccounts of
such professional intermediaries who are bound by any client confidentiality that prohibits disclosure of the
clientdetailstothebanks.
18. Wherefundsheld bythe intermediaries arenot co-mingledat the bank andthere are'sub-accounts', eachofthem
attributable to a beneficial owner, all the beneficial owners must be identified. Where such funds are co-mingled
at the bank, the bank should still look into the beneficial owners. Where the banks rely on the 'customer due

supervised entity and has adequate systems in place to comply with the KYC requirements of the customers. It
shouldbeunderstoodthattheultimateresponsibilityforknowingthecustomerlieswiththebank.
19. Beneficial ownership :When a bank/FI identifies a customer for opening an account, it should identify the
beneficial owner(s) and take all reasonable steps in terms of Rule 9(3) of the PML Rules to verify his identity,
asperguidelinesprovidedbelow:
(a) Where the client is a company, the beneficial owner is the natural person(s), who, whether acting alone or

(f)Where the client or the owner of the controlling interest is a company listed on a stock exchange, or is a
subsidiary of such a company, it is not necessary to identify and verify the identity of any shareholder or
beneficialownerofsuchcompanies.
20.KYC exercise should be done at least every two years for high risk customers, every eight years for medium
risk customers and every ten years for low risk customers. Such KYC exercise may include all measures for
confirming the identity and address and other particulars of the customer that the bank/FI may consider reasonable
and necessary based on the risk profile of the customer, taking into account whether and when client due diligence
measureswerelastundertakenandtheadequacyofdataobtained.
21. Freezingandclosureofaccounts:
(i)Incase of non-compliance of KYC requirements bythe customers despite repeated remindersby banks/FIs,
banks/FIsmayimpose‘partialfreezing’onsuchKYCnon-compliantaccountsinaphasedmanner.
(ai)During the course of such partial freezing, the account holders can revive their accounts by submitting the
KYCdocumentsasperinstructionsinforce.
(bi)While imposing ‘partial freezing’, banks/FIs have to ensure that the option of ‘partial freezing’ is exercised
after giving due notice of three months initially to the customers to comply with KYC requirements to be
followedbyaremindergivingafurtherperiodofthreemonths.
  27
 
28
(v)(iv)Thereafter,banks/FIsmayimpose‘partialfreezing’byallowingallcreditsanddisallowingalldebits
with the freedom to close the accounts If the accounts are still KYC non-compliant after six months of
imposing initial ‘partial freezing’ banks/FIs should disallow all debits and credits from/to the accounts
thereby,renderingtheminoperative.
(vi)Further, it would always be open to the bank/FI to close the account of such customers after issuing due
notice to the customer explaining the reasons for taking such a decision. Such decisions, however, need to be
taken at a reasonably senior level. In the circumstances when a bank/FI believes that it would no longer be
satisfied about the true identity of the account holder, the bank/FI should file a Suspicious Transaction Report
(STR) with Financial Intelligence Unit – India (FIU-IND) under Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance,
GovernmentofIndia.
22.At-parchequefacilityavailedbyco-operativebanks:Some commercialbankshavearrangementswithco-
operativebanks underwhich the latter opencurrent accountswith thecommercial banks and use the cheque book
facility to issue ‘at par’ cheques to their constituents and walk-in- customers for effecting their remittances and
payments.Sincetheb‘atpar’chequefacilityofferedbycommercialbankstoco-operativebanksisinthe natureof
correspondent banking arrangement, banks should monitor and review such arrangements to assess the risks
including credit risk and reputational risk arising there from. For this purpose, banks should retain the right to
verifytherecordsmaintainedbytheclientcooperativebanks/societiesforcompliancewiththeextantinstructions
onKYCandAMLundersucharrangements.
23. In this regard, Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) are advised to utilize the ‘at par’ cheque facility only for
thefollowingpurposes:
(i)Fortheirownuse.
(ii)For their account holders who are KYC complaint provided that all transactions of Rs.50,000/- or
moreshouldbestrictlybydebittothecustomer’saccount.
(iii)For walk-in customers against cash for less than Rs.50,000/- per individual. In order to utilise the ‘at par’
chequefacilityintheabovemanner,UCBsshouldmaintainthefollowing:
(i)Records pertaining to issuance of ‘at par’ cheques covering inter alia applicant’s name and account number,
beneficiary’sdetailsanddateofissuanceofthe‘atpar’cheque
. (ii)Sufficient balances/drawing arrangements with the commercial bank extending such facility for purpose of
honouring such instruments. UCBs should also ensure that all ‘at par’ cheques issued by them are crossed
‘accountpayee’irrespectiveoftheamountinvolved.
30. Simplified norms for Self Help Groups (SHGs) : KYC verification of all the members ofSHG need not bedone
whileopeningthe savingsbankaccount oftheSHG andKYCverificationofalltheofficebearerswouldsuffice.
AsregardsKYCverificationatthe time ofcreditlinkingofSHGs, noseparateKYCverificationofthe members

31. Walk-in Customer : In case of transactions carried out by a non-account based customer, that is a walk in
customer, where the amount of transaction is equal to or exceeds Rs. 50,000/-, whether conducted as a single
transaction or several transactions that appear to be connected, the customer's identity and address should be
verified. Ifa bank has reasonto believe that a customer isintentionally structuringa transaction into a series of
transactions below the threshold of Rs.50,000/- the bank should verify the identity and address of the customer
and also consider filing a Suspicious Transactions Report (STR) to Financial Intelligence Unit – India (FIU-
IND). In terms of Clause (b) (ii) of sub-Rule (1) of Rule 9 of the PML Rules, 2005 banks and financial
institutionsarerequiredtoverifytheidentityofthecustomersforallinternationalmoneytransferoperations.
32. Issue ofDemand Drafts,etc,for more thanRs.50,000/- :Banks should ensure that any remittance offundsby
way of demand draft, mail/telegraphic transfer or any other mode and issue of travellers’ cheques for value of
Rs.50,000/- and above is effected by debit to the customer’s account or against cheques and not against cash
payment. Banks should not make payment of cheques/drafts/pay orders/banker’s cheques if they are presented
beyondtheperiodofthreemonthsfromthedateofsuchinstrument.
33. Unique Customer Identification Code : A Unique Customer Identification Code (UCIC) will help banks to
identify the customers, avoid multiple identities, track the facilities availed, monitor financial transactions in a
holistic manner and enable banks to have a better approach to risk profiling of customers. Banks have been
  28
 
29
advised to allot UCIC while entering into new relationships with individual customers as also the existing
customers.
34. Banks/FIs should put in place a system of periodical review of risk categorization of accounts and the need for
applyingenhancedduediligencemeasures.Suchreviewofriskcategorisationofcustomersshouldbecarriedout

35. Banksshouldcloselymonitorthe transactionsinaccountsofmarketingfirms, especiallyaccountsofMulti-level

sought by the company, there are multiple small deposits (generally in cash) across the country in one bank
account andwhere a largenumber ofcheques areissued bearingsimilar amounts/dates. Wheresuchfeaturesare
noticed by the bank and in case they find such unusual operations in their accounts, the matter should be
immediatelyreportedtoReserveBankandotherappropriateauthoritiessuchasFIU-IND.

closely examine the transactions in order to ensure that they are consistent with their knowledge about the
clients,theirbusinessandriskprofileandwherenecessary,thesourceoffunds.
37. The Board of Directors should ensure that an effective AML/CFT programme is in place by establishing
appropriate procedures and ensuring their effective implementation. It should cover proper management
oversight,systemsandcontrols,segregationofduties,trainingofstaffandotherrelatedmatters.
38. Customers who are likely to pose a higher than average risk should be categorised as medium or high risk
depending on the background, nature and location of activity, country of origin, sources of funds, customer
profile, etc. Customers requiring very high level of monitoring, e.g., those involved in cash intensive business,
PoliticallyExposedPersons(PEPs)offoreignorigin,may,ifconsiderednecessary,becategorisedashighrisk.
39. Correspondent banking is the provision of banking services by one bank (the “correspondent bank”) to another
bank (the “respondent bank”). These services may include cash/funds management, international wire transfers,
drawingarrangementsfordemanddraftsandmailtransfers,payable-through-accounts,chequesclearingetc.
40. Incase ofpayable-through-accounts, the correspondent bank should be satisfied that the respondent bank has
verified the identity of the customers having direct access to the accounts and is undertaking ongoing 'due
diligence' on them. The correspondent bank should ensure that the respondent bank is able to provide the
relevantcustomeridentificationdataimmediatelyonrequest.
41. Banks should ensure that their respondent banks have KYC/AML policies and procedures in place and apply
enhanced 'due diligence' procedures for transactions carried out through the correspondent accounts. Banks
should not enter into a correspondent relationship with a “shell bank” (i.e., a bank which is incorporated in a
country where it has no physical presence and is not affiliated to any regulated financial group). The
correspondentbankshouldnotpermititsaccountstobeusedbyshellbanks.
42. Wire Transfer : Banks/FIs use wire transfers as an expeditious method for transferring funds between bank
accounts. Wire transfers include transactions occurring within the national boundaries of a country or from one
country to another. As wire transfers do not involve actual movement of currency, they are considered as rapid
andsecuremethodfortransferringvaluefromonelocationtoanother.

be made to establish his identity and Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) should be made to FIU-IND. (iii)
When a credit or debit card is used to effect money transfer, necessary information as at (i) above should be
includedinthemessage.
47. RoleofOrdering,IntermediaryandBeneficiarybanks
(i)Ordering Bank : An ordering bank is the one that originates a wire transfer as per the order placed by its
customer. The ordering bank must ensure that qualifying wire transfers contain complete originator
information.Thebankmustalsoverifyandpreservetheinformationatleastforaperiodoffiveyears.
(ii)Intermediary bank : For both cross-border and domestic wire transfers, a bank processing an intermediary
element of a chain of wire transfers must ensure that all originator information accompanying a wire transfer is
retained with the transfer. Where technical limitations prevent full originator information accompanying a cross-
border wire transfer from remaining with a related domestic wire transfer, a record must be kept at least for five
years (as required under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002) by the receiving intermediary bank of all
theinformationreceivedfromtheorderingbank.
(iii)Beneficiary bank :A beneficiary bank should have effective risk-based procedures in place to identify wire
transferslackingcompleteoriginatorinformation.Thelackofcompleteoriginatorinformationmaybeconsidered
as a factor in assessing whether a wire transfer or related transactions are suspicious and whether they should be
reported to the Financial Intelligence Unit-India. The beneficiary bank should also take up the matter with the
ordering bank if a transaction is not accompanied by detailed information of the fund remitter. If the ordering
bank fails to furnish information on the remitter, the beneficiary bank should consider restricting or even
terminatingitsbusinessrelationshipwiththeorderingbank.
48. Maintenanceof recordsoftransactions :Banks/FIs should introduce a system ofmaintaining properrecordof

Intermediaries–casestudy2
Clients in several countries used the services of an intermediary to purchase insurance policies. Identification was
taken from the client bywayofan IDcard,but these detailswere unableto beclarified bythe providing institution
locally, which was reliant on the intermediary doing due diligence checks. The policy was put in place and the

the institution would receive notification from the client stating that there was now a change in circumstances, and
they would have to close the policy suffering the losses but coming away with a clean cheque from the institution.

Collusion–casestudy3
An insurer in collusion with an insured person attempted to launder money through insurance transactions. The
manager of an insurance company sold health and personal injury insurance policies insuring against the liability
from accidents to dummy persons, normally in the names of friends and relatives. These persons paid a low
premium rate. Subsequently claims were received, supported by false documentation and medical certificates to
substantiate the losses and the insurer paid the claims promptly. The claims for damages were considerable. The
manager then sought to legalise this scheme and recover the damages paid out. Under subrogation rights, the
insurancecompanytooklegalactionagainstallbusinesseswheretheallegedaccidentshadoccurred.Thebusinesses
involved (restaurants, clubs etc.) responded that they had not been aware of the alleged accidents and that no such
accidentshadoccurredatthetimesstated.
Collusion–casestudy4
A drug trafficker purchased a life insurance policy with a value of USD 80,000. The policy was purchased through
an agent of a large life insurance company using a cashier’s cheque. The investigation showed that the client had
made it known that the funds used to finance the policy were the proceeds of drug trafficking. In light of this fact,
the agent charged significantly higher commission. Three months following this transaction, the investigation
showedthatthedrugdealercashedinhispolicy.
Reinsurance–casestudy5

this reinsurance cover. This raised the suspicion of the reinsurer which contacted law enforcement agencies.
  73
 
74
Investigation made clear that the investment firm was bogus and controlled by criminals with a drug background.
The insurer had ownership links with the investment firm. The impression is that – although drug money would be
laundered by a payment received from the reinsurer – the main purpose was to create the appearance of legitimacy
by using the name of a reputable reinsurer. By offering to pay above market rate the insurer probably intended to
assurecontinuationofthereinsurancearrangement.
Reinsurance–casestudy6
A group of persons with interests in home construction effected a payment in favour of construction company A

Two life insurance policies were bought for a large amount in the names of Mr X and Mr Y. The payments were
made by cheque, originating from the account of a investment company. Both polices were used as security for a
mortgage loan with a company that specialised in leasing. As the beneficiaries were not the policyholders and in
light of the unusual financing being provided by a leasing company, the insurer contacted the investment company
in order to understand the origin of the money that had been deposited in the account. It appeared that the money

A 34 year old car dealer received a loan through a broker of a life insurance company to purchase a house. He
invested around 25% of the loan in a single-premium life insurance policy. He later surrendered the policy early to
pay back the loan (capital and interest), making up the shortfall through other funds. The use of a substantial
proportion of the loan to purchase a policy combined with the unexpectedly early repayment of the loan led to the
FIU being contacted. The FIU’s investigation revealed that the policyholder was known for stealing and receiving

20. Introduction
1.1. Know Your Customer (KYC) Norms/Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Measures/Combating
ofFinancingofTerrorism(CFT)/ObligationsofbanksunderPMLA,2002
The objective of KYC/AML/CFT guidelines is to prevent banks from being used, intentionally or
unintentionally, by criminal elements for money laundering or terrorist financing activities. KYC
procedures also enable banks to know/understand their customers and their financial dealings better which
inturnhelpthemmanagetheirrisksprudently.
1.2. DefinitionofCustomer
ForthepurposeofKYCpolicy,a‘Customer’isdefinedas:
d apersonorentitythatmaintainsanaccountand/orhasabusinessrelationshipwiththebank;
e one on whose behalf the account is maintained (i.e. the beneficial owner). [Ref: Government of
India Notification datedFebruary 12,2010 - Rule 9, sub-rule (1A) ofPMLA Rules- 'Beneficial
Owner' means the natural person who ultimately owns or controls a client and or the person on
whose behalf a transaction is being conducted, and includes a person who exercise ultimate
effectivecontroloverajuridicalperson]
f beneficiaries of transactions conducted by professional intermediaries, such as Stock Brokers,
CharteredAccountants,Solicitorsetc.aspermittedunderthelaw,and
g any person or entity connected with a financial transaction which can pose significant
reputational orother risks to the bank, say, a wire transfer orissue ofa high value demand draft
asasingletransaction.
2 Guidelines
  80
 
81
1.General
(d) Banks should keep in mind that the information collected from the customer for the
purpose of opening of account is to be treated as confidential and details thereof are not to be divulged for
cross selling or any other like purposes. Banks should, therefore, ensure that information sought from the
customer is relevant to the perceived risk, is not intrusive, and is in conformity with the guidelines issued in
this regard. Any other information from the customer should be sought separately with his/her consent and
afteropeningtheaccount
14. Banks should ensure that any remittance of funds by way of demand draft, mail/telegraphic
transfer or any other mode and issue of travellers’ cheques for value of Rupees fifty thousand and above is
effectedbydebittothecustomer’saccountoragainstchequesandnotagainstcashpayment
15. With effect from April 1, 2012, banks should not make payment of cheques/drafts/pay
orders/banker’s cheques bearing that date or any subsequent date, if they are presented beyond the period of
threemonthsfromthedateofsuchinstrument.
16. Banks should ensure that the provisions of Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010,
whereverapplicable,arestrictlyadheredto.
2.2. KYCPolicy
BanksshouldframetheirKYCpoliciesincorporatingthefollowingfourkeyelements:
17 CustomerAcceptancePolicy;
18 CustomerIdentificationProcedures;
19 MonitoringofTransactions;and
iv)RiskManagement.
2.3.CustomerAcceptancePolicy(CAP)
  81
 
82
19 Every bank should develop a clear Customer Acceptance Policy laying down explicit criteria for
acceptance of customers. The Customer Acceptance Policy must ensure that explicit guidelines are in place on
thefollowingaspectsofcustomerrelationshipinthebank.
a. Noaccountisopenedinanonymousorfictitious/benaminame.
[Ref: Government of India Notification dated June 16, 2010 Rule 9, sub-rule (1C) - Banks
should not allow the opening of or keep any anonymous account or accounts in fictitious
nameoraccountonbehalfofotherpersonswhoseidentityhasnotbeendisclosedorcannot
beverified].
23 Parameters of risk perception are clearly defined in terms of the nature of business activity,
location of customer and his clients, mode of payments, volume of turnover, social and financial status etc. to
enable categorisation of customers into low, medium and high risk (banks may choose any suitable
nomenclature viz. level I, level II and level III). Customers requiring very high level of monitoring, e.g.
PoliticallyExposedPersons(PEPs)may,ifconsiderednecessary,becategorisedevenhigher;
iii)Documentation requirements and other information to be collected in respect of different
categories of customers depending on perceived risk and keeping in mind the requirements of
PMLAct,2002andinstructions/guidelinesissuedbyReserveBankfromtimetotime;
iv)Not to open an account where the bank is unable to apply appropriate customer due diligence
measures, i.e., bank is unable to verify the identity and /or obtain documents required as per the
risk categorisation due to non-cooperation of the customer or non-reliability of the
data/information furnished to the bank. Bank may also consider closing an existing account
under similar circumstances. It is, however, necessary to have suitable built in safeguards to
avoidharassmentofthecustomer.Forexample,decisionbyabanktocloseanaccountshouldbe
takenatareasonablyhighlevelaftergivingduenoticetothecustomerexplainingthereasonsfor
suchadecision.
25. Circumstances,inwhichacustomerispermittedtoactonbehalfofanotherperson/entity,should
be clearly spelt out in conformity with the established law and practice of banking as there could be occasions
whenanaccountisoperatedbyamandateholderorwhereanaccountisopenedbyanintermediaryinfiduciary
capacityand
(i) Necessary checks before opening a new account so as toensure that the identity ofthe customer
does not match with any person with known criminal background or with banned entities such as individual
terroristsorterroristorganisationsetc.
36. Banks should prepare a profile for each new customer based on risk categorisation. The customer
profile may contain information relating to customer’s identity, social/financial status, nature of business
  82
 
83
activity, information about his clients’ business and their location etc. The nature and extent of due diligence
will depend on the risk perceived by the bank. However, while preparing customer profile banks should take
caretoseekonlysuchinformationfromthecustomer,whichisrelevanttotheriskcategoryandisnotintrusive.
The customer profile is a confidential document and details contained therein should not be divulged for cross
sellingoranyotherpurposes.
37. For the purpose of risk categorisation, individuals (other than High Net Worth) and entities whose
identities and sources of wealth can be easily identified and transactions in whose accounts by and large
conformtotheknownprofile,maybecategorisedaslowrisk.Illustrativeexamplesoflowriskcustomerscould
be salaried employees whose salary structures are well defined, people belonging to lower economic strata of
the society whose accounts show small balances and low turnover, Government Departments and Government
owned companies, regulators and statutory bodies etc. Insuch cases, the policy may require that only the basic
requirements of verifying the identity and location of the customer are to be met. Customers that are likely to
pose a higher than average risk to the bank should be categorised as medium or high risk depending on
customer'sbackground,natureandlocationofactivity,countryoforigin,sourcesoffundsandhisclientprofile,
etc. Banks should apply enhanced due diligence measures based on the risk assessment, thereby requiring
intensive‘duediligence’forhigherriskcustomers,especiallythoseforwhomthesourcesoffundsarenotclear.
Inview ofthe risksinvolved incashintensive businesses,accountsofbulliondealers(includingsub-dealers)&
jewelersshouldalsobecategorizedbybanksas'highrisk' requiringenhancedduediligence.Otherexamplesof
customersrequiringhigherduediligenceinclude(a)nonresidentcustomers;

(f)politicallyexposedpersons(PEPs)offoreignorigin,customerswhoarecloserelativesofPEPsandaccounts
of which a PEP is the ultimate beneficial owner; (g) non-face to face customers and (h) those with dubious
reputation as per public information available etc. However, NPOs/NGOs promoted by United Nations or its
agenciesmaybeclassifiedaslowriskcustomers.
48. In addition to what has been indicated above, banks/FIs should take steps to identify and assess their
ML/TFriskfor customers, countries andgeographical areasasalso for products/ services/ transactions/delivery
channels. Banks/FIs should have policies, controls and procedures, duly approved by their boards, in place to
effectively manage and mitigate their risk adopting a risk-based approach. As a corollary, banks would be
requiredtoadoptenhancedmeasuresforproducts,servicesandcustomerswithamediumorhighriskrating.In
this regard, banks may use for guidance in their own risk assessment, a Report on Parameters for Risk-Based
Transaction Monitoring (RBTM) dated March 30, 2011 which was issued by Indian Banks' Association as a
  83
 
84
supplement to their guidance note on Know Your Customer (KYC) norms / Anti-Money Laundering (AML)
standards issued in July 2009. The IBA guidance also provides an indicative list of high risk customers,
products,servicesandgeographies.
49. It is important to bear in mind that the adoption of customer acceptance policy and its implementation
should not become toorestrictive and must not result indenial of bankingservices to general public,especially
tothose,whoarefinanciallyorsociallydisadvantaged.
2.4. CustomerIdentificationProcedure(CIP)
49. The policy approved by the Board of banks should clearly spell out the Customer Identification
Procedure to be carried out at different stages, i.e., while establishing a banking relationship; carrying out a
financial transaction or when the bank has a doubt about the authenticity/veracity or the adequacy of the
previously obtained customer identification data. Customer identification means identifying the customer and
verifying his/her identity by using reliable, independent source documents, data or information. Banks need to
obtain sufficient information necessary to establish, to their satisfaction, the identity of each new customer,
whether regular or occasional, and the purpose of the intended nature of banking relationship. Being satisfied
meansthat the bank must be ableto satisfy the competent authoritiesthat due diligence was observed based on
the risk profile of the customer in compliance with the extant guidelines in place. Such risk-based approach is
considered necessary to avoid disproportionate cost to banks and a burdensome regime for the customers.
Besides risk perception, the nature of information/documents required would also depend on the type of
customer (individual, corporate etc.). For customers that are natural persons, the banks should obtain sufficient
identification data to verify the identity of the customer, his address/location, and also his recent photograph.
For customers that are legal persons or entities, the bank should (i) verify the legal status of the legal
person/entitythroughproperandrelevantdocuments;
(i) verify that any person purporting to act on behalf of the legal person/entity is so authorised and
identify and verify the identity of that person; (iii) understand the ownership and control structure of the
customeranddeterminewhoarethenaturalpersonswhoultimatelycontrolthelegalperson.
54. Banks may seek ‘mandatory’ information required for KYC purpose which the customer is obliged to
give while opening an account or during periodic updation. Other ‘optional’ customer details/additional
information,ifrequiredmaybeobtainedseparatelyaftertheaccountisopenedonlywiththeexplicit consentof

banks should keep in mind that the information (both ‘mandatory’ – before opening the account as well as
‘optional’-afteropeningtheaccountwiththeexplicitconsentofthecustomer)collectedfromthecustomeristo
betreatedasconfidentialanddetailsthereofarenottobedivulgedforcrosssellingoranyotherlikepurposes.
57. Customer identification requirements in respect of a few typical cases, especially, legal persons
requiring an extra element of caution are given in paragraph 2.5 below for guidance of banks. Banks may,
however, frame their own internal guidelines based on their experience of dealing with such persons/entities,
normal bankers’ prudence and the legal requirements as per established practices. If the bank decidesto accept
such accounts in terms of the Customer Acceptance Policy, the bank should take reasonable measures to
identify the beneficial owner(s) and verify his/her/their identity in a manner so that it is satisfied that it knows
whothebeneficialowner(s)is/are[Ref:GovernmentofIndiaNotificationdatedJune16,2010-Rule9sub-rule
(1A)ofPMLRules].
d) In this connection, a reference may be made to the circular DBOD.AML.BC. No. 71/14.01.001/2012-
13 dated January 18, 2013 wherein the procedure for determination of Beneficial Ownership, as
advisedbyGovernmentofIndiahasbeenspecified.
59. The increasing complexityand volume offinancial transactionsnecessitate that customers donot have
multiple identities within a bank, across the banking system and across the financial system. This can be
achieved by introducing a unique identification code for each customer. The Unique Customer Identification
Code(UCIC)willhelpbankstoidentifycustomers,trackthe facilitiesavailed,monitorfinancialtransactionsin
a holistic manner and enable banks to have a better approach to risk profiling of customers. It would also
smoothen banking operations for the customers. While some banks already use UCIC for their customers by
providing them a relationship number, etc., other banks have not adopted this practice. Banks were therefore,
advised to initiate steps for allotting UCIC to all their customers while entering into any new relationships for
individual customers to begin with. Existing individual customers were required to be allotted UCIC by end-
May 2013. However, in view of difficulties expressed by some banks in implementing UCIC for their
customers, for various reasons, and keeping in view the constraints, the time for completing the process of
allottingUCICtoexistingcustomerswasextendeduptoMarch31,2014.Inthisregardafurtherextensionupto
December 31, 2014 has been allowed. Banks have been advised to expedite the procedure and complete the
work of allotting UCIC to all the existing individual customers, within the stipulated timeframe. They may
chalk out a plan for completing the work and furnish the monthly progress report to their Board. Considering
the fact that a period of two years has been allotted for completion of the task, no further extension in this
regardwouldbeconsidered.Further,itisreiteratedthatUCICshouldbeallottedtoallcustomerswhileentering
intonewrelationships.
  85
 
86
60. When there are suspicions of money laundering or financing of the activities relating to terrorism or
where there are doubts about the adequacy or veracity of previously obtained customer identification data,
banks should review the due diligence measures including verifying again the identity of the client and
obtaining information on the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship. [Ref: Government of
IndiaNotificationdatedJune16,2010-Rule9sub-rule(1D)ofPMLRules].
61. It has been observed that some close relatives, e.g. wife, son, daughter and parents, etc. who live with
their husband,father/mother and son, asthe case may be,are findingit difficult to openaccount in some banks
asthe utilitybillsrequiredforaddressverificationarenot intheir name.Itisclarified, that insuch cases,banks
can obtain an identity document and a utility bill of the relative with whom the prospective customer is living
along with a declaration from the relative that the said person (prospective customer) wanting to open an
account is a relative and is staying with him/her. Banks can use any supplementary evidence such as a letter
received through post for further verification of the address. While issuing operational instructions to the
branches on the subject, banks should keep in mind the spirit of instructions issued by the Reserve Bank and
avoidunduehardshipstoindividualswhoare,otherwise,classifiedaslowriskcustomers.
66. Norms for furnishing proof of address have been relaxed to allow submitting only one documentary
proof of address (either current or permanent) while opening a bank account or while undergoing periodic
updation. In case the address mentioned as per ‘proof of address’ undergoes a change, fresh proof of address
may be submitted to the branch within a period of six months. In case the proof of address furnished by the
customer is not the local address or address where the customer is currently residing, the bank may take a
declaration of the local address on which all correspondence will be made by the bank with the customer. No
proof is required to be submitted for such address for correspondence/local address. This address may be
verified by the bank through ‘positive confirmation’ such as acknowledgment of receipt of (i) letter, cheque
books,ATMcards;(ii)telephonicconversation;
(i) visits; etc.Inthe eventof change inthis addressdueto relocationorany other reason, customersmay
intimatethenewaddressforcorrespondencetothebankwithintwoweeksofsuchachange.
70. Some banks insist on opening of fresh accounts by customers when customers approach them for
transferring their account from one branch of the bank to another branch of the same bank. Banks are advised
that KYC once done by one branch of the bank should be valid for transfer of the account within the bank as
long as full KYC has been done for the concerned account. The customer should be allowed to transfer his

n) Ithas beenbrought to our notice that the said indicative list furnishedin Annex -I, isbeing treatedby
some banks as an exhaustive list as a result of which a section of public is being denied access to
banking services. Banks are, therefore, advised to take a review of their extant internal instructions in
thisregard.
2.5. CustomerIdentificationRequirements–IndicativeGuidelines
77. Walk-inCustomers
  87
 
88
Incase of transactionscarriedout bya non-account based customer, that isa walk-in customer, where the
amount of transaction is equal to or exceeds rupees fifty thousand, whether conducted as a single
transaction or several transactions that appear to be connected, the customer's identity and address should
be verified. However, if a bank has reason to believe that a customer is intentionally structuring a
transaction into a series of transactions below the threshold of Rs.50,000/- the bank should verify the
identity andaddressofthe customer and alsoconsider filing asuspicious transaction report(STR) to FIU-
IND.
NOTE: In terms of Clause (b) (ii) of sub-Rule (1) of Rule 9 of the PML Rules, 2005
banks and financial institutions are required to verify the identity of the
customersforallinternationalmoneytransferoperations
b) SalariedEmployees
In case of salaried employees, it is clarified that with a view to containing the risk of fraud, banks should
rely on certificate/letter of identity and/or address issued only from corporate and other entities of repute
and should be aware of the competent authority designated by the concerned employer to issue such
certificate/letter.Further,inadditiontothecertificate/letterissuedbytheemployer,banksshouldinsiston
at least one of the officially valid documents as provided in the Prevention of Money Laundering Rules
(viz. passport,driving licence, PAN Card, Voter’s Identity card,etc.) orutility billsfor KYCpurposes for
openingbankaccountsofsalariedemployeesofcorporateandotherentities.
c) Trust/NomineeorFiduciaryAccounts
There exists the possibility that trust/nominee or fiduciary accounts can be used to circumvent the
customer identification procedures. Banks should determine whether the customer is acting on behalf of
another person as trustee/nominee or any other intermediary. If so, banks should insist on receipt of
satisfactory evidence of the identity of the intermediaries and of the persons on whose behalf they are
acting, as also obtain details of the nature of the trust or other arrangements in place. While opening an
account for a trust, banks should take reasonable precautions to verify the identity of the trustees and the
settlors of trust (including any person settling assets into the trust), grantors, protectors, beneficiaries and
signatories. Beneficiaries should be identified when they are defined. In the case of a 'foundation', steps
shouldbetakentoverifythefoundermanagers/directorsandthebeneficiaries,ifdefined.
d) Accountsofcompaniesandfirms
  88
 
89
Banks need to be vigilant against business entities being used by individuals as a ‘front’ for maintaining
accounts with banks. Banks should examine the control structure of the entity, determine the source of
fundsand identifythe naturalpersonswho haveacontrollinginterest andwho comprise the management.
These requirements may be moderated according to the risk perception e.g. in the case of a public
companyitwillnotbenecessarytoidentifyalltheshareholders.
ii Clientaccountsopenedbyprofessionalintermediaries
a. When the bank has knowledge or reason to believe that the client account opened by a
professionalintermediaryisonbehalfofasingleclient,thatclientmustbeidentified.Banksmay
hold 'pooled' accounts managed by professional intermediaries on behalf of entities like mutual
funds, pension funds or other types of funds. Banks also maintain 'pooled' accounts managed by
lawyers/chartered accountants or stockbrokers for funds held 'on deposit' or 'in escrow' for a
rangeofclients.Wherefundsheldbytheintermediariesarenotco-mingledatthebankandthere
are'sub-accounts', eachofthem attributable toabeneficial owner, all the beneficial ownersmust
beidentified.Wheresuchfundsareco-mingled atthe bank,the bankshouldstill lookthroughto
the beneficial owners. Where the banks rely on the 'customer due diligence' (CDD) done by an
intermediary, they should satisfy themselves that the intermediary is regulated and supervised
andhasadequatesystemsinplacetocomply
with the KYCrequirements. It should beunderstoodthat the ultimate responsibility for knowing
thecustomerlieswiththebank.
ix. Under the extant AML/CFT framework, therefore, it is not possible for professional
intermediaries like Lawyers and Chartered Accountants, etc. who are bound by any client
confidentiality that prohibitsdisclosure ofthe client details, tohold an account onbehalf oftheir
clients. It is reiterated that banks should not allow opening and/or holding of an account on
behalfofa client/s byprofessional intermediaries, like Lawyersand Chartered Accountants,etc.,
whoareunabletodisclosetrueidentityoftheowneroftheaccount/fundsduetoanyprofessional
obligation of customer confidentiality. Further, any professional intermediary who is under any
obligation that inhibits bank's ability to know and verify the true identity of the client on whose
behalf the account is held or beneficial ownership of the account or understand true nature and
purposeoftransaction/s,shouldnotbeallowedtoopenanaccountonbehalfofaclient.
h) AccountsofPoliticallyExposedPersons(PEPs)residentoutsideIndia
  89

i) Politically exposed persons are individuals who are or have beenentrusted with prominent
public functions in a foreign country, e.g., Heads of States or of Governments, senior
politicians, senior government/judicial/military officers, senior executives of state-owned
corporations, important political party officials, etc. Banks should gather sufficient information
on any person/customer of this category intending to establish a relationship and check all the
informationavailableonthepersoninthepublicdomain.Banksshouldverifytheidentityofthe
personand seekinformation aboutthe sources offundsbefore accepting the PEPasacustomer.
The decision to open an account for a PEP should be taken at a senior level which should be
clearly spelt out in Customer Acceptance Policy. Banks should also subject such accounts to
enhancedmonitoringonanongoingbasis.Theabovenormsmayalsobeappliedtotheaccounts

iii)In the event of an existing customer or the beneficial owner of an existing account, subsequently
becoming a PEP, banks should obtain senior management approval to continue the business
relationship andsubject the account tothe CDD measuresasapplicableto thecustomersofPEP
category including enhanced monitoring on an ongoing basis. These instructions are also
applicabletoaccountswhereaPEPistheultimatebeneficialowner.
iv) Further, banks should have appropriate ongoing risk management procedures for identifying and
applying enhanced CDD to PEPs, customers who are close relatives of PEPs, and accounts of
whichaPEPistheultimatebeneficialowner.
99. Accountsofnon-face-to-facecustomers
Withtheintroductionoftelephoneandelectronicbanking,increasinglyaccountsarebeingopenedbybanks
for customers without the need for the customer to visit the bank branch. In the case of non-face-to-face
customers, apart from applying the usual customer identification procedures, there must be specific and
adequate procedures to mitigate the higher risk involved. Certification of all the documents presented
shouldbeinsisteduponand,ifnecessary,additionaldocumentsmaybecalledfor.Insuchcases,banksmay
also require the first payment to be effected through the customer's account with another bank which, in
turn, adheres to similar KYC standards. In the case of cross-border customers, there is the additional
difficulty of matching the customer with the documentation and the bank may have to rely on third party
certification/introduction.Insuchcases,itmustbeensuredthatthethirdpartyisaregulatedandsupervised

h) Accountsofproprietaryconcerns
  90
 
91
Apart from following the extant guidelines on customer identification procedure as applicable to the
proprietor, banks should call for and verify the following documents before opening of accounts in the
nameofaproprietaryconcern:
  91
 
92
Proofofthename,addressand activityofthe concern,likeregistrationcertificate(inthe caseofa
registered concern), certificate/licence issued by the Municipal authorities under Shop &

Registering authority like Certificate of Practice issued by Institute of Chartered Accountants of
India, Institute of Cost Accountants of India, Institute of Company Secretaries of India, Indian
Medical Council, Food and Drug Control Authorities, registration/licensing document issued in
the name of the proprietary concern by the Central Government or State Government
Authority/Department. Banks may also accept IEC (Importer Exporter Code) issued to the
proprietary concern by the office of DGFT, the complete Income Tax Return (not just the
acknowledgement) in the name of the sole proprietor where the firm's income is reflected, duly
authenticated/acknowledged by the Income Tax authorities and utility bills such as electricity,
water, and landline telephone bills in the name of the proprietary concern as required documents

2.6. SellingThirdpartyproducts
When banks sell third party products as agents, the responsibility for ensuring compliance with
KYC/AML/CFT regulations lies with the third party. However, to mitigate reputational risk to bank and to
enableaholisticviewofacustomer’stransactions,banksareadvisedasfollows:
113. Even while selling third party products as agents, banks should verify the identity and address of the
walk-incustomer.
114. Banks should also maintain transaction details with regard to sale of third party products and related
recordsforaperiodandinthemannerprescribedinparagraph2.24below.
115. Bank’s AML software should be able to capture, generate and analyse alerts for the purpose of filing
CTR/STR in respect of transactions relating to third party products with customers including walk-in
customers.
116. Saleofthirdpartyproductsbybanksasagentstocustomers,includingwalk-incustomers, forRs.50,000

2.7. DueDiligenceincorrespondentbankingrelationship
  93
 
94
Some commercial banks have arrangements with co-operative banks wherein the latter open current accounts
with the commercial banks and use the cheque book facility to issue ‘at par’ cheques to their constituents and
walk-in- customers for facilitating their remittances and payments. Since the ‘at par’ facility offered by
commercial banks to co-operative banks is in the nature of correspondent banking arrangements, banks should
monitor and review such arrangements to assess the risks including credit risk and reputational risk arising
therefrom. For this purpose, banks should retain the right to verify the records maintained by the client
cooperative banks/ societies for compliance with the extant instructions on KYC and AML under such
arrangements.
2.8. SimplifiedKYCnormsforForeignPortfolioInvestors(FPIs)
In terms of Rule 9 (14)(i) of the PML Rules, simplified norms have been prescribed for those FPIs who have
been duly registered in accordance with SEBI guidelines and have undergone the required KYC due
diligence/verification prescribed by SEBI through a Custodian/Intermediary regulated by SEBI. Such
eligible/registered FPIs may approach a bank for opening a bank account for the purpose of investment under
Portfolio Investment Scheme (PIS) for which KYC documents prescribed by the Reserve Bank (as detailed in
Annex II of the circular DBOD.AML.BC.No.103/14.01.001/2013-14 dated April 3, 2014) would be required.
For this purpose, banks may rely on the KYC verification done by the third party (i.e. the Custodian/SEBI
RegulatedIntermediary)subjecttotheconditionslaiddowninRule9(2)[(a)to(e)]oftheRules.
2.9. SmallAccounts

2.11. OperationofBankAccounts&MoneyMules
a) It has been brought to our notice that “Money Mules” can be used to launder the proceeds of fraud
schemes (e.g., phishing and identity theft) by criminals who gain illegal access to deposit accounts by
recruiting third parties to act as “money mules.” In some cases these third parties may be innocent

b) Inamoneymule transaction, anindividual with abankaccount isrecruitedto receive cheque deposits
orwire transfers and then transfer these fundstoaccounts held on behalf ofanother personorto other
individuals, minus a certain commission payment. Money mules may be recruited by a variety of
methods, including spam e-mails, advertisements on genuine recruitment web sites, social networking
sites, instant messaging and advertisements in newspapers. When caught, these money mules often
have their bank accounts suspended, causing inconvenience and potential financial loss, apart from
facinglikelylegalactionforbeingpartofafraud.Manyatimestheaddressandcontactdetailsofsuch

c) The operations of such mule accounts can be minimised if banks follow the guidelines on opening of
accounts and monitoring of transactions contained in this Master Circular. Banks are, therefore,
advised to strictly adhere to the guidelines on KYC/AML/CFT issued from time to time and to those
relating to periodical updation of customer identification data after the account is opened and also to
monitoring of transactions in order to protect themselves and their customers from misuse by such
fraudsters.

2.13. MonitoringofTransactions
a) Ongoing monitoring is an essential element of effective KYC procedures. Banks can effectively
control and reduce their risk only if they have an understanding of the normal and reasonable activity
of the customer so that they have the means of identifying transactions that fall outside the regular
patternofactivity.However,theextentofmonitoringwilldependontherisksensitivityoftheaccount.

whichhavenoapparenteconomicorvisiblelawfulpurpose.Banksmayprescribe
  97
 
98
threshold limits for a particular category of accounts and pay particular attention to the transactions
which exceed these limits. Transactions that involve large amounts of cash inconsistent with the
normal and expectedactivity ofthe customer should particularlyattract the attentionofthe bank. Very
high account turnover inconsistent with the size of the balance maintained may indicate that funds are
being 'washed' through the account. High-risk accounts have to be subjected to intensified monitoring.
Everybankshouldsetkeyindicatorsforsuchaccounts,takingnoteofthebackgroundofthecustomer,
suchasthe countryoforigin, sourcesoffunds, the typeoftransactionsinvolved andother riskfactors.
High risk associated with accounts of bullion dealers (including sub-dealers) & jewelers should be
taken into account by banks to identify suspicious transactions for filing Suspicious Transaction
Reports(STRs)toFinancial IntelligenceUnit-India(FIU-IND).Banksshouldputinplaceasystem of
periodical review of risk categorization of accounts and the need for applying enhanced due diligence
measures. Such review ofrisk categorisationof customers should be carriedout at a periodicity of not
lessthanonceinsixmonths.
b) Ithas come to our notice that accounts ofMulti-level Marketing (MLM) Companies were misused for
defrauding public byluring them into depositing their money with the MLM company by promising a
high return. Such depositors are assured ofhigh returns and issued post-dated cheques for interest and
repayment of principal. So long as money keeps coming into the MLM company’s account from new
depositors, the cheques are honoured but once the chain breaks, all such post-dated instruments are
dishonoured.Thisresultsinfraudonthepublicandisareputationalriskforbanksconcerned.Further,
banks should closely monitor the transactions in accounts of marketing firms. In cases where a large
number of cheque books are sought by the company, there are multiple small deposits (generally in
cash) across the country in one bank account and where a large number of cheques are issued bearing
similar amounts/dates, the bank should carefully analyse such data and in case they find such unusual
operations in accounts, the matter should be immediately reported to Reserve Bank and other
appropriate authorities such as Financial Intelligence Unit India (FIU-Ind) under Department of
Revenue,MinistryofFinance.

IndiaNotificationdatedJune16,2010-Rule9,sub-rule(1B)]
d) The risk categorization of customers as also compilation and periodic updation of customer profiles
and monitoring and closure of alerts in accounts by banks are extremely important for effective
implementation of KYC/AML/CFT measures. It is, however, observed that there are laxities in
effective implementation of the Reserve Bank’s guidelines in this area, leaving banks vulnerable to
  98
 
99
operational risk. Banks should, therefore, ensure compliance with the regulatory guidelines on
KYC/AML/CFT both in letter and spirit. Accordingly, banks were advised to complete the process of
risk categorization and compiling/updating profiles of all of their existing customers in a time-bound
manner,byend-March2013.
2.14. Closureofaccounts
Wherethe bankisunabletoapplyappropriateKYCmeasuresdue tonon-furnishingofinformationand/or
non-cooperation by the customer, the bank should consider closing the account or terminating the
banking/business relationship after issuing due notice to the customer explaining the reasons for taking
suchadecision.Suchdecisionsneedtobetakenatareasonablyseniorlevel.
2.15. RiskManagement
a) The BoardofDirectorsofthe bankshouldensure that aneffective KYCprogramme isput inplace by
establishingappropriateproceduresandensuringtheireffectiveimplementation.Itshouldcoverproper
management oversight, systems and controls, segregation of duties, training and other related matters.
Responsibility should be explicitly allocated within the bank for ensuring that the bank’s policies and
procedures are implemented effectively. Banks should, in consultation with their boards, devise
procedures for creating risk profiles of their existing and new customers, assess risk in dealing with
various countries, geographical areas and also the risk of various products, services, transactions,
delivery channels, etc. Banks’ policies should address effectively managing and mitigating these risks
adoptingarisk-basedapproachasdiscussedinPara2.3(d)above.
b) Banks’ internal audit and compliance functions have an important role in evaluating and ensuring
adherence to the KYC policies and procedures. As a general rule, the compliance function should
provide an independent evaluation of the bank’s own policies and procedures, including legal and
regulatory requirements. Banks should ensure that their audit machinery is staffed adequately with
individuals who are well-versed in such policies and procedures. Concurrent/ Internal Auditors should
specifically check and verify the application of KYC procedures at the branches and comment on the
lapses observed in this regard. The compliance in this regard should be put up before the Audit
CommitteeoftheBoardonquarterlyintervals.

Banksshouldpayspecialattentiontoany moneylaundering threatsthat may arisefromnew ordeveloping
technologies including internet banking that might favour anonymity, and take measures, if needed, to
prevent their use in money laundering schemes. Many banks are engaged in the business of issuing a
variety of Electronic Cards that are used by customers for buying goods and services, drawing cash from
ATMs, and can be used for electronic transfer of funds. Banks are required to ensure full compliance with
all KYC/AML/CFT guidelines issued from time to time, in respect of add-on/ supplementary cardholders
also. Further, marketing of credit cards is generally done through the services of agents. Banks should
ensure that appropriate KYC procedures are duly applied before issuing the cards to the customers. It is
alsodesirablethatagentsarealsosubjectedtoKYCmeasures.
2.17. CombatingFinancingofTerrorism
IntermsofPMLARules,suspicioustransactionshouldinclude,interalia,
a. Transactions, which give rise to a reasonable ground of suspicion that these may involve financing of
the activities relating to terrorism. Banks are, therefore, advised to develop suitable mechanism
through appropriate policy framework for enhanced monitoring of accounts suspected of having
terrorist links and swift identification of the transactions and making suitable reports to FIU-Ind on
priority.
b. As and when list of individuals and entities, approved by Security Council Committee established
pursuant to various United Nations' Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs), are received from
Government of India, Reserve Bank circulates these to all banks and financial institutions.
Banks/Financial Institutions should ensure to update the lists of individuals and entities as circulated
by Reserve Bank. The UN Security Council has adopted Resolutions 1988 (2011) and 1989 (2011)
which have resulted in splitting of the 1267 Committee's Consolidated List into two separate lists,
namely:
i) “Al-Qaida Sanctions List”, which is maintained by the 1267 / 1989 Committee. This list shall
include only the names of those individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-
Qaida. The Updated Al-Qaida Sanctions List is available at

2.19.JurisdictionsthatdonotorinsufficientlyapplytheFATFRecommendations
a) Banks are required to take into account risks arising from the deficiencies in AML/CFT regime of the
jurisdictions included in the FATF Statement. In addition to FATF Statements circulated by Reserve
Bank of India from time to time, (latest as on June 30, 2014, being our circular DBOD.
AML.No.15245/14.01.001/2013-14 dated March 05, 2014) banks should also consider publicly
available information for identifying countries, which do not or insufficiently apply the FATF
Recommendations. It is clarified that banks should also give special attention to business relationships
and transactions with persons (including legal persons and other financial institutions) from or in
countries that do not or insufficiently apply the FATFRecommendations and jurisdictions included in
FATFStatements.
b) Banks should examine the background and purpose of transactions with persons (including legal
persons and other financial institutions) from jurisdictions included in FATF Statements and countries
that do not or insufficiently apply the FATF Recommendations. Further, if the transactions have no
apparenteconomic orvisible lawful purpose, the background and purpose ofsuchtransactions should,
asfaraspossiblebeexamined,andwrittenfindingstogetherwithalldocumentsshouldberetainedand
made availabletoReserveBank/otherrelevantauthorities,onrequest.
2.20. CorrespondentBankingandShellBank
a) Correspondentbankingistheprovisionofbankingservicesbyonebank(the“correspondentbank”)to
another bank (the “respondent bank”). These services may include cash/funds management,
international wire transfers, drawing arrangements for demand drafts and mail transfers, payable-
  104
 
105
through-accounts, cheques clearing etc. Banks should gather sufficient information to understand fully
the nature of the business of the correspondent/respondent bank. Information on the other bank’s
management, major business activities, level of AML/CFT compliance, purpose of opening the
account, identity of any third party entities that will use the correspondent banking services, and
regulatory/supervisory framework in the correspondent's/respondent’s country may be of special
relevance. Similarly, banks should try to ascertain from publicly available information whether the
other bank has been subject to any money laundering or terrorist financing investigation or regulatory
action. While it is desirablethat such relationships should be established only with the approval ofthe
Board, in case the Boards of some banks wish to delegate the power to an administrative authority,
they may delegate the power to a committee headed by the Chairman/CEO of the bank while laying
down clear parameters for approving such relationships. Proposals approved by the Committee should
invariably be put up to the Board at its next meeting for post facto approval. The responsibilities of
eachbankwithwhomcorrespondent bankingrelationshipisestablishedshouldbeclearlydocumented.
Inthecaseofpayable-through-accounts,thecorrespondentbankshouldbesatisfiedthattherespondent
bank has verified the identity of the customers having direct access to the accounts and isundertaking
ongoing 'due diligence' on them. The correspondent bank should also ensure that the respondent bank
isabletoprovidetherelevantcustomeridentificationdataimmediatelyonrequest.
b) Correspondentrelationshipwitha“ShellBank”
Banks should refuse to enter into a correspondent relationship with a “shell bank” (i.e. a bank which is
incorporated in a country where it has no physical presence and is unaffiliated to any regulated financial
group).ShellbanksarenotpermittedtooperateinIndia.Banksshouldnotenterintorelationshipwithshell
banks and before establishing correspondent relationship with any foreign institution, banks should take
appropriate measures to satisfy themselves that the foreign respondent institution does not permit its
accountstobeusedbyshellbanks.Banksshouldbeextremelycautiouswhilecontinuingrelationshipswith
correspondent banks located in countries with poor KYC standards and countries identified as 'non-
cooperative' in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. Banks should ensure that their
respondent banks have anti money laundering policies and procedures in place and apply enhanced 'due
diligence'proceduresfortransactionscarriedoutthroughthecorrespondentaccounts.

Theguidelinescontainedinthismastercircularshallapplytothebranchesandmajorityownedsubsidiaries
located abroad, especially, in countries which do not or insufficiently apply the FATF Recommendations,
to the extent local laws permit. When local applicable laws and regulations prohibit implementation of
these guidelines, the same should be brought to the notice of Reserve Bank. In case there is a variance in
KYC/AML standards prescribed by the Reserve Bank and the host country regulators, branches/overseas
subsidiariesofbanksarerequiredtoadoptthemorestringentregulationofthetwo.
2.22. WireTransfer
  105
 
106
Banks use wire transfers as an expeditious method for transferring funds between bank accounts. Wire
transfersincludetransactionsoccurringwithinthe nationalboundariesofacountryorfromone countryto
another. As wire transfers do not involve actual movement of currency, they are considered as rapid and
securemethodfortransferringvaluefromonelocationtoanother.

ii) Cross-border transfer means any wire transfer where the originator and the beneficiary bank or
financial institutions are located in different countries. It may include any chain of wire
transfersthathasatleastonecross-borderelement.
iii) Domesticwiretransfermeansanywiretransferwheretheoriginatorandreceiverarelocatedin

the borders of a single country even though the system used to effect the wire transfer may be
locatedinanothercountry.
iv) The originatoris the account holder, orwhere there isno account, the person(natural orlegal)
thatplacestheorderwiththebanktoperformthewiretransfer.
b) Wire transfer is an instantaneous and most preferred route for transfer of funds across the globe and
hence, there is a need for preventing terrorists and other criminals from having unfettered access to
wire transfers for moving their funds and for detecting any misuse when it occurs. This can be
achievedifbasicinformationontheoriginatorofwiretransfersisimmediatelyavailabletoappropriate
law enforcement and/or prosecutorial authorities in order to assist them in detecting, investigating,
prosecuting terrorists or other criminals and tracing their assets. The information can be used by
Financial Intelligence Unit - India (FIU-IND) for analysing suspicious or unusual activity and
disseminatingitasnecessary.Theoriginatorinformationcanalsobeputtousebythebeneficiarybank
to facilitate identification and reporting of suspicious transactions to FIU-IND. Owing to the potential
terrorist financing threat posed by small wire transfers, the objective is to be in a position to trace all
wire transfers with minimum threshold limits. Accordingly, banks must ensure that all wire transfers
areaccompaniedbythefollowinginformation:
1. Cross-borderwiretransfers
i) All cross-border wire transfers must be accompanied by accurate and meaningful
originatorinformation.
ii) Information accompanying cross-border wire transfers must contain the name and
addressoftheoriginatorandwhereanaccountexists,thenumberofthataccount.Inthe
  106
 
107
absence of an account, a unique reference number, as prevalent in the country
concerned,mustbeincluded.
iii) Where several individual transfers from a single originator are bundled in a batch file
for transmission to beneficiaries in another country, they may be exempted from
including full originator information, provided they include the originator’s account
numberoruniquereferencenumberasat(ii)above.
2. Domesticwiretransfers
i) Information accompanying all domestic wire transfers of Rs.50000/- (Rupees Fifty
Thousand) and above must include complete originator information i.e. name, address
andaccountnumberetc.,unlessfulloriginatorinformationcanbemadeavailabletothe
beneficiarybankbyothermeans.
ii) If a bank has reason to believe that a customer is intentionally structuring wire transfer
tobelowRs. 50000/-(Rupees Fifty Thousand) toseveral beneficiariesinordertoavoid
reportingormonitoring,thebankmustinsistoncompletecustomeridentificationbefore
effecting the transfer. In case of non-cooperation from the customer, efforts should be
madetoestablish hisidentity andSuspiciousTransactionReport(STR)shouldbemade

c) Exemptions
Interbank transfers and settlements where both the originator and beneficiary are banks or financial
institutionswouldbeexemptedfromtheaboverequirements.
d) RoleofOrdering,IntermediaryandBeneficiarybanks
i)OrderingBank
Anordering bankisthe one that originatesa wiretransfer asperthe orderplacedbyitscustomer.
The ordering bank must ensure that qualifying wire transfers contain complete originator
information. The bank must also verify and preserve the information at least for a period of ten
years.
ii) Intermediarybank
For both cross-border and domestic wire transfers, a bank processing an intermediary element of
achainofwiretransfersmust ensurethat all originatorinformationaccompanyingawiretransfer
is retained with the transfer. Where technical limitations prevent full originator information
  107
 
108
accompanying a cross-border wire transfer from remaining with a related domestic wire transfer,
a record must be kept at least for ten years (as required under Prevention of Money Laundering
Act, 2002) by the receiving intermediary bank of all the information received from the ordering
bank.
iii) Beneficiarybank
Abeneficiarybank shouldhave effectiverisk-based proceduresinplacetoidentify wiretransfers
lacking complete originator information. The lack of complete originator information may be
considered as a factor in assessing whether a wire transfer or related transactions are suspicious
and whether they should be reported to the Financial Intelligence Unit-India. The beneficiary
bankshouldalsotakeupthematterwiththeorderingbankifatransactionisnotaccompaniedby
detailed information of the fund remitter. If the ordering bank fails to furnish information on the
remitter, the beneficiary bank should consider restricting or even terminating its business
relationshipwiththeorderingbank.

Explanation: Government ofIndia Notification dated November 12, 2009- Rule 2 sub-rule (1) clause (ca)
defines Non-Profit Organization (NPO). NPO means any entity or organisation that is
registered as a trust or a society under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 or any
similar State legislation or a company registered under section 25 of the Companies
Act,1956.
ii) The earlier prescribed multiple data files reporting format has been replaced by a new single
XML file format. FIU-IND has released a comprehensive reporting format guide to describe
the specifications of prescribed reports to FIU-IND. FIU-IND has also developed a Report
Generation Utility and Report Validation Utility to assist reporting entities in the preparation
of prescribed reports. The OM issued on Reporting Formats under Project FINnet dated 31st
March,2011 by FIU containing all relevant details are available on FIU’s website. Banks In
this regard, a reference is also invited to circulars DBOD.AML.BC.No.39/14.01.001/2012-13
and DBOD.AML.BC.No.49/14.01.001/2012-13 dated September 7, 2012 and October 11,
2012 respectively. Accordingly, banks should carefully go through all the reporting formats
prescribed by FIU-IND. Accordingly, banks should carefully go through all the reporting
formatsprescribedbyFIU-IND.
iii) FIU-IND have placed on their website editable electronic utilities to enable banks to file
electronic CTR/STR who are yet to install/adopt suitable technological tools for extracting
CTR/STRfromtheir live transactiondatabase.Itis, therefore,advised that incasesofbanks,
where all the branches are not fully computerized, the Principal Officer of the bank should
cull out the transaction details from branches which are not yet computerized and suitably
arrange to feed the data into an electronic file with the help of the editable electronic utilities

2.25. VariousReportingFormats
a) CashTransactionReport(CTR)
While detailed instructions for filing all types of reports are given in the instructions part of the related
formats,banksshouldscrupulouslyadheretothefollowing:
  112
 
113
i) The Cash Transaction Report (CTR) for each month should be submitted to FIU-IND by
15th of the succeeding month. Cash transaction reporting by branches to their controlling
officesshould,therefore,invariablybesubmittedonmonthlybasis(notonfortnightlybasis)
and banks should ensure to submit CTR for every month to FIU-IND within the prescribed
timeschedule.
ii) All cash transactions, where forged or counterfeit Indian currency notes have been used as
genuine should be reported by the Principal Officer to FIU-IND in the specified format not
later than seven working days from the date of occurrence ofsuch transactions (Counterfeit
Currency Report – CCR). These cash transactions should also include transactions where
forgery of valuable security or documents has taken placeand may be reported to FIU-IND
inplaintextform.
iii) While filing CTR, details of individual transactions below Rupees Fifty thousand need not
befurnished.
iv) CTR should contain only the transactions carried out by the bank on behalf of their
clients/customersexcludingtransactionsbetweentheinternalaccountsofthebank.
v) A summary of cash transaction report for the bank as a whole should be compiled by the
Principal Officer ofthe bank everymonth inphysical formasper the format specified. The
summaryshouldbesignedbythePrincipalOfficerandsubmittedtoFIU-India.
vi) In case of Cash Transaction Reports (CTR) compiled centrally by banks for the branches
having Core Banking Solution (CBS) at their central data centre level, banks may generate
centralised Cash Transaction Reports (CTR) in respect of branches under core banking
solutionatonepointforonwardtransmissiontoFIU-IND,provided:
a) TheCTRistobegeneratedintheformatprescribedbyFIU-IND;
b) A copy of the monthly CTR submitted on its behalf to FIU-India is available at the
concernedbranchforproductiontoauditors/inspectors,whenaskedfor;and
c) The instruction on ‘Maintenance of records of transactions’; ‘Information to be
preserved’ and ‘Maintenance and Preservation of records’ as contained above in this
Master Circular at Para 2.24 (a), (b) and (c) respectively are scrupulously followed by
thebranch.
However, in respect of branches not under CBS, the monthly CTR should continue to be compiled and
forwardedbythebranchtothePrincipalOfficerforonwardtransmissiontoFIU-IND.
b) SuspiciousTransactionReports(STR)
i) While determining suspicious transactions, banks should be guided by definition of
suspicioustransactioncontainedinPMLARulesasamendedfromtimetotime.
  113
 
114
ii) It is likely that in some cases transactions are abandoned/aborted by customers on being
asked to give some details or to provide documents. It is clarified that banks should report
allsuchattempted transactionsinSTRs,even ifnot completedbycustomers, irrespectiveof
theamountofthetransaction.
iii) Banks should make STRs if they have reasonable ground to believe that the transaction
involve proceeds of crime generally irrespective of the amount of transaction and/or the
thresholdlimitenvisagedforpredicateoffencesinpartBofScheduleofPMLA,2002.
iv) The STR should be furnished within seven days of arriving at a conclusion that any
transaction, whether cash or non-cash, ora seriesoftransactions integrally connected areof
suspicious nature. The Principal Officer should record his reasons for treating any
transaction or a series of transactions as suspicious. It should be ensured that there is no
undue delayin arrivingat such aconclusiononce asuspicioustransactionreportisreceived
from a branch or any other office. Such report should be made available to the competent
authoritiesonrequest.
v) In the context of creating KYC/AML awareness among the staff and for generating alerts
for suspicious transactions, banks may consider the indicative list of suspicious activities
containedinAnnex-Eofthe'IBA's
GuidanceNoteforBanks,January2012’.
vi) Banks should not put any restrictions on operations in the accounts where an STR has been made.

2.26. CustomerEducation/Employee'sTraining/Employee'sHiring
  114
 
115
a) CustomerEducation
Implementation of KYC procedures requires banks to demand certain information from customers which
may be of personal nature or which has hitherto never been called for. This can sometimes lead to a lot of
questioning by the customer as to the motive and purpose of collecting such information. There is,
therefore,aneedforbankstopreparespecificliterature/pamphletsetc.soastoeducatethecustomerofthe
objectives of the KYC programme. The front desk staff needs to be specially trained to handle such
situationswhiledealingwithcustomers.
b) Employees’Training
Banksmust haveanongoingemployee trainingprogramme sothatthe membersofthe staffareadequately
trained in KYC procedures. Training requirements should have different focuses for frontline staff,
compliance staff and staff dealing with new customers. It is crucial that all those concerned fully
understandtherationalebehindtheKYCpoliciesandimplementthemconsistently
c) HiringofEmployees
Itmaybeappreciatedthat KYCnorms/AML standards/CFT measureshave beenprescribedto ensurethat
criminals are not allowed to misuse the banking channels. It would, therefore, be necessary that adequate
screening mechanism is put in place by banks as an integral part of their recruitment/hiring process of
personnel.
